# LILYGO-TF-Shield_T-Display-S3_Basic_SD_Card
Examples for the TF card shield on a T-Display-S3 by Lilygo, using SD_MMC one bit mode

To my surprise the code from the Lilygo github page doesn't work out of the box. Then the struggle with the lack of documentation for the SD_MMC library. I found it very challenging to get this working, 3 evenings of scrathing my head brought me to what I am sharing here.

I hope this helps you with your projects. Get it working and these boards are pretty cool.
